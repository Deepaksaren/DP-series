The first line of input contains an integer value of 'n'. It is the total number of houses.

The second line of input contains 'n' integer values separated by a single space denoting the amount of money each house has.
Output format :
Print the the maximum money that can be looted.
Constraints :
0 <= n <= 10 ^ 4

Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1 :
6
5 5 10 100 10 5
Sample Output 1 :
110
Sample Input 2 :
6
10 2 30 20 3 50
Sample Output 2 :
90
Explanation of Sample Output 2 :
Looting first, third, and the last houses([10 + 30 + 50]) will result in the maximum loot, and all the other possible combinations would result in less than 90.

    if len(houses) ==0:
        return 0
    dp[0] = houses[0]
    dp[1] = max(houses[0], houses[1])
    for i in range(2, n):
        dp[i] = max(houses[i]+dp[i-2], dp[i-1])
    return dp[n-1]


def maxMoneyLooted(houses, n) :
    dp = [0]*(n)
    return helper(houses, n, dp)
